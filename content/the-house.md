# The House

The Alpha Chi Omega house is located at 1069 Morewood Ave. on the southeast corner of the Greek Quad. The house serves as a living space for a number of the sisters but also as a safe, relaxing environment for all sisters and guests

The four-level house includes two levels of bedrooms which can accommodate 33 women, an industrial kitchen for our chef, a kitchenette for sister's to use, a dining area, multiple lounge areas, and a large space for chapter meetings.

***Living in the House***

If you ask any AX&#937 sister living in the house, they will tell you that their favorite thing about living in the house is always having someone to hang out with and talk to. Proximity to campus, well maintained facilities and amazing food courtesy of our Chef, Debbie also rank pretty high on their list of favorite things about the house. Everyday is a chance to bond with other sisters.

## Meal Plan

Alpha Chi Omega is lucky enough to be the only sorority on campus to live in a facility with an industrial kitchen. Alpha Chi employs Chef Debbie who provides the sisters with a healthy, affordable meal plan. The plan includes lunches Monday through Friday and dinners Monday through Thursday (with leftovers available for the weekends). 

Sisters who have dietary restrictions or need to cook for an event may also utilize our kitchenette, where we provide basic cooking ingredients and various beverages.
