# Sisterhood

Alpha Chi Omega's motto is "Together let us seek the heights." Joining Alpha Chi means joining a group of women who are not only dedicated to achieving their dreams, but also dedicated to supporting each other along the way.

Life at Carnegie Mellon is challenging and rewarding. By joining Alpha Chi, we make a promise to each other to help our sisters when they struggle and celebrate their successes. We support each other. We're the cheer squad at the big game, the enthusiastic audience at your recital or opening, and the ones clapping and crying at graduation. We're there for the big things and the small ones.

## What Makes Us Home

Part of our sisterhood is our house. It's the people that make it special, but the Alpha Chi house is a home away from home. Instead of walking past a desk attendant, you walk into a home filled with friends.

## Sisterhood Activities

Sisters can always be found spending time together, whether it be in the chapter house or on campus. Whether at home watching movies together or just being silly, or out working together on academics or service. It's these moments together that help foster such a strong relationship. 

## Bigs and Littles

One of the perks of being an Alpha Chi is our process of Big and Little sister matching. Your big is your mentor. They'll shower you with affection, and be there for you come what may. It's these bonds between sisters that makes Alpha Chi Omega a home away from home.

Being an Alpha Chi means being among women who share similar values, interests, and ambitions. It's forming bonds of friendship with your sisters, that will last far beyond college. 

## Sorority Life

> People ask why I am in a sorority and I try to explain all the things a sorority is that they cannot see. A sorority is more than letters on a sweatshirt, I say. More than traditional songs, a gold pin, rituals, an obligation, or a way of life. A sorority is learning about people, a sorority is a way of giving without expecting a return. A sorority is earning respect from others, as well as for yourself. A sorority will not solve all your problems. But I have made good friends and found confidence there to help me take life one step at a time.
