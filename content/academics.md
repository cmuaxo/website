# Academics at AX&#937;


## We value academics and learning.

### It's a priority.

- we require that all sisters maintain at least a 2.5 QPA. 
- we have study hours

### So much that we invite our professors to meet our sisters.

Apple Pie with Alpha Chi.

- invite professors to dessert reception
- get to know them outside class
- *smart* sorority women

"The chapter also hosts an event called Apple Pie with Alpha Chi each semester to honor sisters who receive a 4.0 GPA for that semester and to invite professors and staff to come mingle with some truly talented young women."

## CMU is hard. We support each other.

- struggling people get help. we've got a guy for that.
