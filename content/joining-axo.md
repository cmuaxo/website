# Joining AX&#937;

Hi there! We're glad that you are thinking about joining Alpha Chi Omega! There are two ways that new members join AX&#937;: FMR and COB/IMR. Keep reading below to find out what those (ever so mysterious) acronyms mean!


## FMR, <s>Freshmen Making Rounds</s>

FMR (actually) stands for Formal Membership Recruitment. Formal Membership Recruitment is when women who are interested in going Greek visit each sorority house on campus. FMR is a 'structured mutual selection process' run by the National Panhellenic Conference. In human-speak, this means that FMR has a set timeline and rules. 

Every night during FMR, you visit fewer houses. Which houses you go back to depends both on your preferences (you say which you want to go back to) and houses' invitations. Houses invite you back based on how well they think you fit their membership criteria based on your conversations with sisters from that house. At AX&#937;, the membership criteria we consider are: academic interest, character, leadership ability, personal development, and financial responsibility.

[At Carnegie Mellon, FMR happens during the Fall Semester over four nights](http://www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/student-life/greek/govcouncils/pha/recruitment.html), starting on a Thursday night and ending on a Sunday. If you're interested in participating in FMR, you can [sign up through the CMU Greek Life site](http://www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/student-life/greek/govcouncils/pha/recruitment.html). You can also find out more about sorority life at CMU by going to Greek events at the beginning of the Fall semester. Even if you're not too sure about Greek life, going to the beginning of the semester events is a great way to <s>get free food</s> meet new people and learn how things are at CMU.


## COB/IMR, <s>Come On By/It's More Relaxed</s>

COB/IMR are two different acronyms for the same thing. COB stands for "Continuous Open Bidding" and IMR stands for "Infomal Membership Recruitment". Basically, when chapters haven't reached the total number of members they are allowed to have after FMR ends, they can invite other women to join their chapter (giving out 'bids') later in the Fall and Spring semesters.

Informal recruitment at Alpha Chi Omega is exactly that: informal. Potential Members are invited to relaxed, fun-filled events so that they can meet more sisters and get an idea of what itâ€™s like to be in AX&#937 . If we think AX&#937; is a good fit for both the potential member and the chapter, we offer them a bid (inviting them to join).
