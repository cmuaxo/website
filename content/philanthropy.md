# Philanthropy at AX&#937;

## Domestic Violence Awareness

One out of four women are survivors of domestic violence. And **one out of three** college-aged women are affected by domestic violence.

Alpha Chi Omega's official philanthropy is domestic violence awareness. We work to prevent domestic violence, raise awareness about its severity, educate others on how to recognize and address it, and support organizations that assist survivors of domestic violence and their children.

## Things We Do

### Fundraising for Domestic Violence Awareness

The money we raise for Domestic Violence Awareness benefits two organizations. Locally, we support the Pittsburgh Women's Shelter. We also support the national [Alpha Chi Omega Foundation](http://www.alphachiomega.org/index.aspx?id=239), which helps to fund charities for domestic violence awareness, prevention and education, and assistance to survivors and their children.

### Events

Throughout the year, our chapter hosts many events to fundraise for domestic violence awareness. 

#### Walk A Mile in Her Shoes

At the end of October, we host an event called “Walk A Mile In Her Shoes.” [Walk a Mile In Her Shoes](http://www.walkamileinhershoes.org/) is an "international men's march to stop rape, sexual assualt, and gender violence". 

Our chapter organizes a Walk A Mile in Her Shoes event each year at CMU. Men who participate are sponsored for each mile they walk, and the proceeds go to the Pittsburgh Women's Shelter.

#### Ultimate Ninja Tournament

During the Fall, we organize an 'Ultimate Ninja' Tournament on Campus called Ninjas Against Domestic Violence. If you aren't familiar with the game 'Ultimate Ninja', you can see it played in the video below:

We charge a few dollars to participate in the tournament, and donate all the proceeds to the Pittsburgh Women's Shelter.

#### Vera Bradley Sale

Every February (just in time for Mother's Day) we sell [Vera Bradley](http://www.verabradley.com/) accessories on campus. The sale is co-sponsored by Cheeks Boutique in Shadyside, and 15% of each sale goes to either the Pittsburgh Women's Shelter or the Alpha Chi Omega Foundation.

#### All You Can Eat Mac and Cheese

All You Can Eat Mac and Cheese is one of our annual events. We sell tickets to an all-you-can-eat mac and cheese buffet, and donate all proceeds to the Pittsburgh Women's Shelter.

#### Luminaries

During the Fall semester, sisters sell luminaries (candle lights) to raise money for the Pittsburgh Women's Shelter. Then, one night, we place the luminaries around campus to raise awareness about Domestic Violence.

#### A Chai O

At the beginning of the spring semester, we have a new event called Alpha Chai Omega, where we sell hot chai tea to raise money for the Alpha Chi Omega Foundation.

### Domestic Violence Awareness Month

During October, which is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, sisters gather together and host bake sales, knit scarves, and collect donations to support both the Pittsburgh Women's Shelter and the Alpha Chi Omega Foundation, donating annually to various charities which help survivors and raise awareness about domestic violence.

### Volunteering for Local Organizations

Some semesters, groups of sisters have volunteered as mentors and tutors at [Gwen's Girls](http://www.gwensgirls.org/index.php), a local organization that to support young women who have survived domestic violence or are otherwise at risk.

### Other Service Work

Though Domestic Violence Awareness is our primary philanthropy, we encourage and honor sisters for doing other service work in the community. This semester, sisters volunteered for diverse causes and organizations&mdash;these are just a few:

- Helping to table for and run blood drives on campus
- Science outreach to high school students with [Biosac](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/org/BioSAC/Index.htm)
- Computer science outreach for high school students through [Women@SCS](http://women.cs.cmu.edu/)
- Running in the [Pineapple 5K](http://wpa.pineapple.llsevent.org/ng/index.cfm/a3205be/regPages/pages/?p=104108) to raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society
- Running in the [Color Me Rad](http://www.colormerad.com/races/pittsburgh.html) race to raise money for Ronald McDonald House in Pittsburgh
- Keeping local neighborhoods clean through Adopt A Block

#### Greek Sing

At CMU's annual "Greek Sing" show, the fraternities and sororities at CMU create and perform short Broadway musical montages. All of the proceeds from Greek Sing go to a chosen philanthropy. From 2010-2014, that philanthropy is [the Children's Institute of Pittsburgh](http://www.amazingkids.org/). 

In 2012, Alpha Chi Omega partnered with Sigma Chi and took first place in the doubles category for our performance of "Footloose". You can see the video of the performance below:
